I'm an A-level student studying:
- Maths :pencil:
- Further maths :triangular_ruler:
- Physics :telescope:
- Computer science :computer:

<br>

I like all aspects of coding, having done projects such as:
- Machine Learning :robot:
- Internet of Things :signal_strength:
- Websites :mag:
- Apps :iphone:
- Games :video_game:

<br>

I'm currently working on physics simulations because I think it'll be benefitial for a degree in physics :mortar_board:.
I'm creating a simulation of the solar system :milky_way: using Newtonian physics. In the future, I hope to create a more accurate version that incorporates relativity.
I also aim to create other simulations such as pendulums, particle interactions :atom: and fluid dynamics :ocean:

In terms of languages, I know: Python, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, PHP, Swift and C#
